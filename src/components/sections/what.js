      <p>Most existing protocols for collateral-backed lending with ERC-20 tokens are overly complex. They rely heavy on token-economics, have long and complicated smart contracts and are tied to non-transparent oracle mechanisms for price feeds.<br /><br />Commodo is created as an open-source framework so transparency is of paramount importance. Aimed at your average developer, the contracts are easy to read and redeploy. The unique setup with <a href="https://tellor.io/" target="blank">Tellor Oracle</a> makes for a clear and open infrastructure, true to blockchain-nature.</p>
